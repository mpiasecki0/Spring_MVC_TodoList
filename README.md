# Spring_MVC_TodoList
A loosely coupled Spring Boot/REST/JPA/Security Web Application.

## What this Application does

This Application is an "Enterprise Edition" of a simple TodoList App combining a lot of amazing technologies like Spring Boot, Security, Data JPA, REST and the templating engine Thymeleaf to render the front-end. The Code was written in a loosely coupled/modular way to easily swap out components like Services/Databases or Views. Therefore, it is a pleasure to mock/test and work with.

### Prerequisites

This Application is using plain Java & the build tool Maven with the latest release of the Spring Framework (5), so I recommend the latest version of the JDK which you can download for free from Oracle. Other than that you just need to clone and import it as a Maven project and it should be ready to run.
